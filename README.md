# CSE322final

This website is a product of the Computer Science & Engeneering course 'Web Page Programming' during my semester abroad at the California State University San Bernardino, USA.
It contains four webpages which relate to my experience of studying abroad. It represents the HTML and CSS as well as some Javascript skills I have gained throughout the course. It uses the OpenWeatherMap Api to access weather information of a specific city.
The website is completely responsive.
